Welcome to the Snake game! The objective of this game is to keep the snake alive and growing.
The snake grows as it eats food. Upon game startup, the snake only has its head, shown by one
box on the display. The first time the snake eats, its body emerges with just one box. The snake
gains an additional box on its body after each subsequent meal. When the snake does not eat any 
food within a maximum amount of time, selected by the user upon game startup, it loses one box of 
its head + body. When there are no boxes left (i.e., no head or body), the snake dies and the 
game is over. The snake will also die if one of the body cells is in the same location as the head
cell (basically, the snake eats itself). This can happen if the direction of the snake is changed
too rapidly.

The game can be played at one of three levels: basic, intermediate, or advanced. In all three
levels of the game, food is placed at a random location on the screen, both initially and after 
each time the snake eats. The behavior of both the snake and the food depend on the difficulty 
level chosen by the user, as explained below.

Basic:
  * Snake: each time the snake eats, its speed increases by 0.02
  * Food: always stationary
Intermediate:
  * Snake: each time the snake eats, its speed increases by 0.025
  * Food: 1) moves in a constant, horizontal direction, always from left to right; 2) the speed
    of the food is 1/2 the speed of the snake
Advanced:
  * Snake: each time the snake eats, its speed increases by 0.03
  * Food: 1) moves in a direction generally away from the snake; 2) the speed of the food is 3/4
    the speed of the snake

The score increases each time the snake eats based on this formula:
score = score + 1 + (difficulty level) * 10 * (speed of the food), in which Basic = 0, 
  Intermediate = 1, and Advanced = 2

To start the game, enter "./SnakeGame" within the .../CppND-Capstone-Snake-Game/build directory.
You will then be prompted to enter the difficulty level to which you want to play and the maximum
amount of time the snake can go between meals. Movement of the snake is controlled via the up, down,
left, and right arrows on the keyboard.
